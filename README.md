Command line utility for publishing your code on pastebin.com
Current version - 0.0.1

I often ask questions on irc and forums. So, I had to paste my code into public accessible places such as pastebin.com. This process was pretty much boring - you go to the text editor, you copy everything, you go to the website, you paste it. 
I've decided to create a little utility(my first!) to make this process easier. 

As soon as this is my first gem please let me know if you notice some ugly code or architecture.
