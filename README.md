Command line utility for publishing your code on pastebin.com
Current version - 0.1.2

I often ask questions on irc and forums. So, I had to paste my code into public accessible places such as pastebin.com. This process was pretty much boring - you go to the text editor, you copy everything, you go to the website, you paste it. 
I've decided to create a little utility to make this process easier. 
Now it copies the url of the paste to the system clipboard using the clipboard gem.

As soon as this is my first gem please let me know if you notice some ugly code or architecture. 

TODO:

1. + Handle missing mandatory arguments 
2. + Copy URL to the system clipboard
3. Add file extension recognizer
